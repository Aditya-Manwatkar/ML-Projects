# Basic Meachine Learning Projects Repository

Welcome to the **Basic Meachine Learning Projects Repository**! Whether you're a beginner or an experienced data enthusiast, this repository is your gateway to understanding fundamental ML techniques. Dive in, explore, and enhance your skills!

## Overview
This repository aims to provide clear and concise implementations of essential machine learning algorithms. Each algorithm is accompanied by detailed explanations, sample code, and practical examples. Whether you're building predictive models, tackling classification problems, or diving into regression tasks, we've got you covered.

## Algorithms Included
1. **Linear Regression**: Understand the basics of regression modeling and how to predict continuous outcomes.
2. **Polynomial Regression**: Understand the basics of polynomial regression and their used cases.
3. **Logistic Regression**: Dive into binary classification using logistic regression.
4. **Decision Trees**: Learn how to create decision trees for both classification and regression tasks.
5. **Random Forests**: Explore ensemble methods by combining multiple decision trees.
6. **K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)**: Discover the power of instance-based learning.
7. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Master the art of separating data with hyperplanes.
8. **Naive Bayes**: Get hands-on experience with probabilistic classifiers.
9. **K-Means Clustering**: Uncover hidden patterns in your data.

## Datasets
We've collected a set of small, easy-to-understand datasets in the `data` directory. These datasets cover various domains, including housing prices, iris flowers, and customer churn. Use them to practice and experiment with the algorithms.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/Aditya-Manwatkar/ML-Projects.git`
2. Install dependencies (if any) mentioned in the README.
3. Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` folder to learn, experiment, and apply the algorithms.
